# EXPLORATION

Explore the repo and fill your context window with relevant information that will allow you to complete the task.

Read `CONTEXT.md` (if it exists) so test names and interface vocabulary match the project's domain language, and respect ADRs in the area you're touching.

Pay extra attention to test files that touch the relevant parts of the code.

Pay extra attention to `CODING_STANDARDS.md` (if it exists) and follow its conventions.

# TEST-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT

Implement using the red → green → refactor loop. Every section applies on every cycle — consult them before and during the loop, not after.

## What a good test is

Tests verify behavior through public interfaces, not implementation details. Code can change entirely; tests shouldn't. A good test reads like a specification — "user can checkout with valid cart" tells you exactly what capability exists — and survives refactors because it doesn't care about internal structure.

**Good tests** — integration-style, test through real interfaces:

```typescript
// GOOD: Tests observable behavior
test("user can checkout with valid cart", async () => {
  const cart = createCart();
  cart.add(product);
  const result = await checkout(cart, paymentMethod);
  expect(result.status).toBe("confirmed");
});
```

Characteristics:
- Tests behavior users/callers care about
- Uses public API only
- Survives internal refactors
- Describes WHAT, not HOW
- One logical assertion per test

**Bad tests** — implementation-detail tests coupled to internal structure:

```typescript
// BAD: Tests implementation details
test("checkout calls paymentService.process", async () => {
  const mockPayment = jest.mock(paymentService);
  await checkout(cart, payment);
  expect(mockPayment.process).toHaveBeenCalledWith(cart.total);
});
```

Red flags:
- Mocking internal collaborators
- Testing private methods
- Asserting on call counts/order
- Test breaks when refactoring without behavior change
- Test name describes HOW not WHAT
- Verifying through external means instead of interface

```typescript
// BAD: Bypasses interface to verify
test("createUser saves to database", async () => {
  await createUser({ name: "Alice" });
  const row = await db.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = ?", ["Alice"]);
  expect(row).toBeDefined();
});

// GOOD: Verifies through interface
test("createUser makes user retrievable", async () => {
  const user = await createUser({ name: "Alice" });
  const retrieved = await getUser(user.id);
  expect(retrieved.name).toBe("Alice");
});
```

**Tautological tests** — expected value restates the implementation:

```typescript
// BAD: Expected value is recomputed the way the code computes it
test("calculateTotal sums line items", () => {
  const items = [{ price: 10 }, { price: 5 }];
  const expected = items.reduce((sum, i) => sum + i.price, 0);
  expect(calculateTotal(items)).toBe(expected);
});

// GOOD: Expected value is an independent, known literal
test("calculateTotal sums line items", () => {
  expect(calculateTotal([{ price: 10 }, { price: 5 }])).toBe(15);
});
```

## Seams — where tests go

A **seam** is the public boundary you test at: the interface where you observe behavior without reaching inside. Tests live at seams, never against internals.

**Test only at pre-agreed seams.** Before writing any test, identify the seams under test. No test is written at an unconfirmed seam. You can't test everything — agreeing the seams up front is how testing effort lands on the critical paths and complex logic instead of every edge case.

Ask: "What's the public interface, and which seams should we test?"

## Anti-patterns

- **Implementation-coupled** — mocks internal collaborators, tests private methods, or verifies through a side channel. The tell: the test breaks when you refactor but behavior hasn't changed.
- **Tautological** — the assertion recomputes the expected value the way the code does, so it passes by construction and can never disagree with the code. Expected values must come from an independent source of truth — a known-good literal, a worked example, the spec.
- **Horizontal slicing** — writing all tests first, then all implementation. Bulk tests verify _imagined_ behavior: you test the _shape_ of things rather than user-facing behavior, the tests go insensitive to real changes, and you commit to test structure before understanding the implementation. Work in **vertical slices** instead — one test → one implementation → repeat, each test a **tracer bullet** that responds to what the last cycle taught you.

## Mocking

Mock at **system boundaries** only:
- External APIs (payment, email, etc.)
- Databases (sometimes — prefer test DB)
- Time/randomness
- File system (sometimes)

Don't mock:
- Your own classes/modules
- Internal collaborators
- Anything you control

Design for mockability:
- Use dependency injection — pass external dependencies in rather than creating them internally
- Prefer SDK-style interfaces over generic fetchers — create specific functions for each external operation instead of one generic function with conditional logic

## Rules of the loop

- **Red before green.** Write the failing test first, then only enough code to pass it. Don't anticipate future tests or add speculative features.
- **One slice at a time.** One seam, one test, one minimal implementation per cycle.
- **Refactoring is not part of the loop.** It belongs to the review stage, not the red → green implementation cycle.

# EXECUTION

Work in vertical slices:

1. Identify the seam to test
2. Write one failing test (RED)
3. Write the minimum implementation to pass (GREEN)
4. Repeat for the next slice
5. After all slices pass, run the full test suite

Do not add speculative features or anticipate future tests.

# FEEDBACK LOOPS

- Run `npm run typecheck` regularly (after each meaningful change)
- Run individual test files regularly to catch failures early
- Run `npm run test` (full suite) once at the end to verify nothing is broken

# COMMIT

Make a git commit. The commit message must:

1. Start with `RALPH:` prefix
2. Include task completed + PRD reference
3. Key decisions made
4. Files changed
5. Blockers or notes for next iteration

Keep it concise.

# THE ISSUE

If the task is not complete, leave a comment on the issue with what was done.

Do not close the issue — this will be done later.

Once complete, output <promise>COMPLETE</promise>.

# FINAL RULES

ONLY WORK ON A SINGLE TASK.
